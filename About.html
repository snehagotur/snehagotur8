        <b>What Life means to me ?</b><br />
        Life is so much more than merely pursuing the norms of the soceity but trying to be good person in my own accord.
        <br />it is not about wildly chasing dreams to be superior over others. <br />
        life is about passion , freedom and love. i will only walk this road once; i might as well make the most of it.
